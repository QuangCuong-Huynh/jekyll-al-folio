- **QA & Compliance Automation** — Implementing **NIST, CIS, ISO 27001**, and **Azure CAF Blueprints** into CI/CD pipelines to ensure continuous assurance and audit readiness.  
- **Full-Stack Development** — Experience with **.NET Core, Python (Django), and React**, emphasizing clean architectures and maintainable patterns (MVC/MVVM).  
- **Observability & Reliability** — Building robust **monitoring, logging, and alerting** pipelines with open-source and cloud-native tools.

## 🧩 Philosophy

> *“Architecture is not just about systems — it’s about trust, clarity, and sustainability.”*

I believe that modern architecture should unite **automation, observability, and compliance** into one cohesive ecosystem — empowering teams to deliver software that is **secure by default and auditable by design**.
